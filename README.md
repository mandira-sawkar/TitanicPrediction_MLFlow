> **Objective:**
To use mlflow for logging and querying machine learning experiments. The task
is to build, log, and track multiple versions of a classification model that aims to
predict the passengers who survived the titanic shipwreck.

> **Context:**
Developing a machine learning model is an iterative process. It involves various
rounds of training and evaluation. There are multiple tools that are used for
streamlining the machine learning operations. We will be using mlflow for
logging and tracking the experiments which will help us to analyze how accurate
the predictions are being made and also compare the performance of the
multiple experiments and we can tweak the model parameters to ensure the
best performance.
